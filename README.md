# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.
## 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 9, 2017
Today's Progress : 
Started 100 days of code, 
Started React Netflix Clone - I am full of motivation to do that!

Thoughts: There are so many tools I should learn in order to develop React apps better.
Let's start!

### Day 2: June 10, 2017

Today's Progress: 
Continued with React Netflix clone – Added Semantic UI, Sliders section,
I was surprised to see there is a new React Router version – v4 with significant difference.
Trying to learn the new featured and when to use Switch,
Spending an hour figuring out how to implement the new version >.< 
Made a header Slider myself – a proud achievement since I want to improve my Flex and CSS skills.
Today’s achievements: 
•	Header section
•	Category Movies section
•	Figuring out how to read the docs correctly without searching direct answers on Stack Overflow

### Day 3: June 11, 2017

Today's Progress: 
Finished React Neflix Clone home page
Moved from React Router v4 to v3 – My brain cannot understand now how to migrate to the new version.
Used Radium – pretty nice and straightforward tool for styling in React,
But I shouldn’t use it for large-scale apps.



Thoughts: In all  modesty, I think I made a pretty successful clone.
I seperated the project to the neccessary components and made a very clear structure.
However, There are a few tools I would like to learn - eg. SCSS and Redux.
Can't wait to learn more!

### Day 4: June 12, 2017

Today's Progress: 
Started FreeCodeCamp Mission - Pomodoro Clock using ReactJS and Grommet.
Also, published an article in Medium explaining how to use Grommet with Webpack 2 after I saw there isn't any tutorial for it -
[Using Grommet with Webpack 2 — Create React App](https://medium.com/@60noypearl/using-grommet-with-webpack-2-create-react-app-33be9a078b59)
I mostly built today the skeleton and tomorrow I'm going to make it work :D 

Thoughts: Grommet is a wonderful library, offering a handful of components and very well documented.
I'm going to learn SASS during this week and implement this knowledge in this project,
so,
Good luck to me [This time I won't give up and just use inline css with js]

### Day 5: June 13, 2017

Today's Progress: 
Added the functionality, made the clock tick, added stop and start buttons.
At start I tried to style using scss but I figured out I should make the clock work first and style at the end.

Thoughts: I should improve the structure and make smaller components.
Tomorrow I will do that and hopefully finish the functionality so
I could start styling and finally learn SCSS =)
