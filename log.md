# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 9, 2017 
 

**Today's Progress**:  Continued my Github Viewer project, started figuring out Flexbox better and using Native Base

**Thoughts:** I realize how amazing React Native is after I developed an app using Native Android Studio.
Impressed by the possibilities with Native Base.
